      An Essay on the Evolutionary History of Humans

        The evolutionary history of modern humans is a controversial topic for some.  It may contradict one's religion or ego.  This can be observed from cases in the news where there are disputes over teaching evolution in public schools<span class='small'><a href='#7'>(7)</a></span>.
But evolution is one of the fundamental theories of biology.  There is an overwhelming mound of evidence that supports humankind's evolution from animals similar to other species of apes that are on earth now, to the intelligent species that now dominates the earth.  Strong evidence for evolution comes from fossil evidence and the anatomical and genetic similarities of species both extant, or still in existence, and extinct<span class='small'><a href='#2'>(2)</a></span>. <br /><br />

        Science is concerned with hypotheses that can be falsified, or proven wrong.  After enough evidence is collected, a hypothesis may be sound enough to be accepted as true.  Then it may become part of a larger theory, which is a scientific model that is accepted as true by the scientific community<span class='small'><a href='#5'>(5)</a></span>.  
        Unlike the way the word is used in colloquial talk, where it means something less certain than facts, in scientific terms a theory is a well established explanation that is very unlikely to be refuted<span class='small'><a href='#1'>(1)</a></span>.  
        Evolution is one such broad theory.  The evolution of human beings is called hominid evolution.  Hominids are all species that evolved from the last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, which goes back to around five million years ago<span class='small'><a href='#3'>(3)</a></span>.  <br /><br />
      </div>

      <div class='essay-body'>
        Species are often classified using a taxonomical classification, which shows relationships among species.  Humans are scientifically named homo sapiens, and belong to the genus homo.  We are part of the hominidae family, or great apes, which also includes gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangatangs, which is then a part of the haplorrhini suborder, which includes monkeys, apes, and tarsiers<span class='small'><a href='#4'>(4)</a></span>. 
        This classification is useful in getting an idea of what other living species homo sapians are closely related to.  But to find out the history of hominid evolution, we can look at the classification of hominid fossils. <br /><br />

      The first primates appeared about 65 million years ago.  Early primates looked similar to small primates that exist today, such as lemurs and tarsiers.  About 15 million years ago the first apelike species appeared<span class='small'><a href='#3'>(3)</a></span>.  
       The earliest hominid fossils that have been found date from about 3.5-5 million years ago, some of which show links to chimpanzees.  The next most recent group of fossils date from about 2.5-4.2 years ago, and are called the Australopithecines.  These species of hominids show evidence of bipedilism, or walking on two legs, brain enlargement, and using tools<span class='small'><a href='#3'>(3)</a></span>. 
       These are important physical factors which show that these species are a link between earlier species of apes and homo sapiens.  Homo habilis and homo rudolfensis fossils that have been found date from about 1.7-2.3 million years ago.  They had a larger brain size and may have used stone tools.  Fossils from other species of homo have been found that date from .2-1.9 million years ago.  These species had larger brain sizes and used tools as well<span class='small'><a href='#3'>(3)</a></span>. <br /><br />
    </div>

    <div class='essay-body'>
  Overall, these fossils that have been found show gradual patterns of physiological changes.  They show a pattern of molor enlargement, smaller face sizes, larger brains, and bipedalism<span class='small'><a href='#3'>(3)</a></span>. 
 As our ancestors' intelligence progressed, the tools that they used highlight this progression.  Simple chopping tools were used about 2.5 million years ago, more complex, symmetrical tools were used about 1.4 million years ago, and flaking tools were used about 300,000 years ago.<span class='small'><a href='#3'>(3)</a></span><br /><br />

  When looking at the big picture, it may be mind boggling as to how a species can evolve into a new species over time.  It happens very slowly, from a process called natural selection.  Natural selection happens when one trait survives and another one doesn't, either from sexual selection or from environmental pressures.  If this favored trait stems from a random genetic mutation in an organism's genes, a new trait may be passed down throughout generations.  
Eventually this line of offspring may become so different that it can be classified as a new species that has arisen from many generations of random genetic mutations that were naturally selected<span class='small'><a href='#6'>(6)</a></span>. <br /><br />

  Human evolution is a fascinating subject.  We are much more intelligent than all other species on the earth (at least so we think)<span class='small'><a href='#8'>(8)</a></span>.  There will always be some mystery as to how exactly we evolved, at least until we can travel back in time, that is.  But with our advanced technologies in genetical testing and with new archeological finds that are constantly being made, we are learning more every day.  Over time we developed larger brains relative to body size, bipedalism, and tools that allowed us to hunt and get more protein, and we shared this technology through sophisticated socialization, allowing us to evolve into the most advanced species on earth.<br /><br />
